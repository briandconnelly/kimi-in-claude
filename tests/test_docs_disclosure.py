"""The doc half of cli_contract.py's egress-disclosure RULE is enforced too.

`cli_contract.py`'s "Implicit Kimi context" RULE binds every egress-caveat prose site
— code *and* docs — to disclose both skills roots. Its code half already fails the gate
when it regresses (the guarantee matchers in `test_server.py`, plus the manifest
snapshot). Its doc half had no guard at all, so a disclosure change could land enforced
in code and silently incomplete in prose. #358 is the evidence: eight sites had to be
found and corrected by hand after #300 updated only some of them.
