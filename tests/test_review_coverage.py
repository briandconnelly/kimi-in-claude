"""Coverage computation for kimi_review_changes / kimi_dry_run (#319).

`build_coverage` turns a gathered DiffResult + scope into the agent-visible Coverage
object: what was reviewable, what was omitted, and why. `complete` must mean "nothing
was left unreviewed", so redaction and truncation — not just omitted untracked files —
make coverage `partial`.
