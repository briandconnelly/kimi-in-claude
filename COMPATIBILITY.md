# Compatibility with the `kimi` CLI

This plugin shells out to the OpenAI `kimi` CLI. Every assumption it makes lives in
`src/kimi_in_claude/cli_contract.py`, so an upstream change is centralized and greppable — though
incorporating one takes the lockstep procedure in
[`docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md`](docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md), not a single edit.
Design goal: **fail loudly and safely, never silently weaken a guarantee.**

Verified against `kimi-cli 0.147.0`.

## Platform support

**macOS or Linux (POSIX) only.** The async-job safety layer — `fcntl` advisory locks
(pid-reuse / zombie-worker guards), process-group teardown (`os.killpg` /
`start_new_session`), and `SIGTERM`-driven graceful cancellation — is POSIX-only. On a
non-POSIX platform these guarantees quietly degrade to owned-children-only locking and
direct-PID kills that orphan `kimi`'s child processes, so the server refuses to start
there instead of shipping a half-safe process model.

- [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) reports `os.name == "posix"` and
  is unaffected (it *is* Linux).
- `KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM=1` downgrades the startup refusal to a
  stderr warning for operators who knowingly accept consult-only, unsupported use; do not
  use `kimi_delegate`/`kimi_review_changes` against untrusted work in that mode.

The `pyproject.toml` trove classifiers declare `Operating System :: MacOS` and
`Operating System :: POSIX :: Linux` (not `OS Independent`) so PyPI reflects this.

## What we invoke

- `kimi exec --json --sandbox <mode> --cd <dir> --output-last-message <file> [--output-schema <file>]
  [--ephemeral] [--ignore-user-config] [--ignore-rules] [--skip-git-repo-check] [--add-dir <dir>]
  [--model <m>] -` — prompt delivered on **stdin** (the trailing `-`), keeping context out of argv.
- `kimi app-server` — short-lived JSON-RPC sessions, driven by `kimi_transfer` (session import)
  and by `kimi_status`'s rate-limit read (`account/rateLimits/read`, no model spend — see #321).
  See "Session transfer" below.
- `kimi --version`, `kimi login status`, `kimi exec --help` — free local probes.

Every paid call family — `kimi_consult[_async]`, `kimi_review_changes[_async]`, and
`kimi_delegate[_async]` — runs its model work on `kimi exec` alone. None uses the native
`kimi review`/`kimi exec review` subcommand, and none uses the `app-server`
JSON-RPC/broker protocol, which was the source of most of the upstream `kimi-plugin-cc`
reliability issues. Reviews use `kimi exec` with a diff we gather ourselves.

**Why not native review — re-verified at kimi-cli 0.144.1 (issue #124).** `kimi exec review`
now advertises `--output-schema`, `--output-last-message`, and `--json`, but `--output-schema` is
**accepted and silently ignored**. A clean-room run —

```sh
kimi exec review --uncommitted --ignore-user-config --ignore-rules --strict-config \
  --ephemeral --output-schema <strict FINDINGS_OUTPUT_SCHEMA> --output-last-message <file> --json
```

— exits 0 yet writes free-form prose (not schema-conforming JSON) to the last-message file, and no
structured-findings payload appears anywhere in the `--json` event stream (only `command_execution`
items and one prose `agent_message`). Native review therefore can't back our strict result contract. Two lesser notes:
`kimi exec review` has **no `--sandbox` flag** (config-based read-only control was not tested), and
the historical "output depends on the user's Kimi MCP fleet" concern was **not re-tested** this
pass — it appears mitigable via `--disable remote_plugin`. Adopting native review remains blocked on
`--output-schema` alone; re-open the question only if a future Kimi honors it.

Two flows reach the `app-server` surface: `kimi_transfer` (transcript import) and `kimi_status`'s
rate-limit read (`account/rateLimits/read`, added for #321 when kimi 0.144 moved quota off the
`kimi exec` stream). Both are quarantined the same way: the surface is experimental upstream, so
every assumption lives in `cli_contract.py` and `appserver.py`, neither call spends model tokens, and
no paid call depends on either. The rate-limit read verifies against **kimi-cli 0.147.0** (probe:
drive `kimi app-server` and confirm `account/rateLimits/read` returns a quota block; an integration
test does this live). See "Session transfer" below for the import flow.

## Sandbox modes

`--sandbox` is the capability boundary for a run (`cli_contract.py`): `read-only` for the
consult/review tiers, `workspace-write` for the propose tiers (`kimi_delegate`,
`kimi_delegate_async`); we never pass `danger-full-access` or `--dangerously-bypass-*` by default.

**`workspace-write` permits filesystem writes inside the workspace but blocks network egress.** This
is kimi's own sandbox boundary and we pass it through deliberately. The practical consequence: a
propose/apply task **cannot perform network operations** — `git push`/`fetch`, `gh ...`, `curl`,
`npm publish`, dependency installs, etc. all fail inside the sandbox (typically with a
`Could not resolve host` / DNS error). Delegated tasks must therefore be self-contained; do any
network step yourself after reviewing and applying the returned diff. The tool docstrings and the
`kimi_capabilities` `negative_scope` state this so a calling agent doesn't assume write access
implies internet access.

## Remote-plugin isolation (`remote_plugin`, #287)

Kimi **0.143+** flipped the `remote_plugin` feature to **default-on**, which makes named
third-party connectors (GitHub, Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, Notion, …) available to the model on
every run. Those connectors are network side-effect / data-disclosure channels **outside** the
`--sandbox` filesystem boundary, so they are incompatible with this server's safe, read-only-by-default
posture. Crucially, `--ignore-user-config` does **not** neutralize them: plugins load from marketplace
snapshots (`~/.cache/kimi-runtimes/`, `~/.kimi/.tmp/bundled-marketplaces/`), not `config.toml`.

The server therefore sends **`--disable remote_plugin`** on **every model-bearing `kimi exec` call**,
regardless of tier or isolation (`cli_contract.py`: `DISABLE_FEATURE_FLAG` + `REMOTE_PLUGIN_FEATURE`,
emitted in `kimi.build_exec_command`). It is an **ALWAYS_SEND** guarantee-bearing flag:

- `--disable <FEATURE>` is documented as exactly `-c features.<FEATURE>=false`, and it wins over any
  `--enable`/`-c features.remote_plugin=true` **regardless of order**.
- An **unknown feature name fails loud** (`Error: Unknown feature flag`), so a future rename/removal of
  `remote_plugin` upstream surfaces as `cli_contract_changed` at arg-parse — zero spend — rather than a
  silent posture regression. Verify with a tool-surface probe on each Kimi upgrade.

**Scope and boundary.** The guarantee covers model-bearing `kimi exec` calls (consult/review/delegate);
it does not describe the separate `kimi app-server` path used by `kimi_transfer` (no model call). And
like the sandbox/approval `-c` denials below, it is bounded by the **`--profile` operator-trust
boundary** — an opaque profile this server cannot inspect could re-enable the feature, so only enable
that knob with profiles you control.

## Implicit Kimi context (`AGENTS.md`, both skills roots, #300, #358)

`kimi exec` **automatically loads** the resolved workspace's `AGENTS.md` into model context and
**auto-discovers** skills from two roots (per upstream docs: name/description metadata up front; a
skill's body loads when the skill is selected):

- the workspace's **`.agents/skills/`** — project-level, and
- **`$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/`** (default `~/.kimi/skills/`) — **user-global, discovered from outside
  the workspace**, so no choice of workspace excludes it.

It needs no tool-directed read, and every model-bearing call in this plugin runs `kimi exec`, so
that content can reach OpenAI even when the caller's prompt never mentions those files. Verified
empirically against kimi-cli 0.147.0 (2026-08-07, issues #300 and #358) — including an A/B against
0.146.0, whose presence matrix was identical, so the user-global discovery is pre-existing rather
than new. The behavior is invisible in
`kimi exec --help` (no flag, no subcommand), so the mechanical help-drift check cannot catch
upstream changes to it. Upstream docs:
[AGENTS guidance](https://developers.openai.com/kimi/concepts/customization#agents-guidance) and
[skills](https://developers.openai.com/kimi/concepts/customization#skills).

**The isolation flags do not suppress it.** `--ignore-user-config` and `--ignore-rules` cover
specific `$KIMI_CODE_HOME` state — `config.toml` and execpolicy `.rules` respectively — and **not**
`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`, or `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/`; no `isolation` value changes this. The
user-global case is the surprising one: `--ignore-user-config` reads as broad user-level isolation
but drops only `config.toml`, and a probe run *with* that flag still emitted a `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/`
skill body. (The plugin's default `isolation=inherit` does not even send the flag — see
`config.isolation_flags`.) For the delegate tools the `AGENTS.md`/skills seeded into the throwaway
worktree (committed content plus replayed uncommitted tracked changes; untracked files are not
copied) auto-load there too, and the user-global skills load alongside them — neither tracked nor
seeded, so scrubbing the worktree does not exclude them.

### Re-verifying on a Kimi upgrade

Marker probes are the only way to observe any of this. Run them against **both** the new binary and
the previous one; [`docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md`](docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md) step 2A covers retrieving the
old binary. **Every row of the table below needs its own marker** — a row whose marker is absent produces a trivial negative that looks identical to a real
one, so the probe would report "unchanged" no matter what upstream did. Build the fixture as
`<parent>/repo`, where `repo` is a scratch git repo (`git init` + one commit) and `<parent>` is
**outside** it, with a distinct codeword in each of these five places:

| Marker | Path | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| Project `AGENTS.md` | `repo/AGENTS.md` | positive control |
| Project skill | `repo/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | positive control |
| Global skill | `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — **temporary** | row 1 |
| Claude-dir skill | `repo/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | row 2 |
| Parent `AGENTS.md` | `<parent>/AGENTS.md` (above the git root) | row 3 |

Each `SKILL.md` needs YAML frontmatter — `---` / `name: <name>` / `description: <one line>` / `---`
— then the codeword in the body. **A skill without frontmatter is silently not discovered**, which
would make a "not discovered" result indistinguishable from upstream having changed. The two
positive controls are what make the negatives meaningful: if the project `AGENTS.md` codeword or the
`.agents/skills/` marker fails to appear, the instrument is broken and every negative below is
worthless — fix the fixture before recording anything.

Then run **two** consults with `--cd <parent>/repo` (a consult is single-turn, so this cannot be one
call), neither mentioning those files:

- **Discovery** — ask it to list every available skill by name and every codeword visible in
  context, and to name explicitly which of the five markers it can and cannot see. Requesting each
  marker by name is what separates "not discovered" from "the model did not bother to mention it".
- **Body egress** — ask it to use the global marker skill by name and report the codeword in its
  body. The codeword coming back confirms the body reached the model.

Run both with **`isolation=ignore-config`** (or the raw CLI flag set including
`--ignore-user-config`). The plugin's default `isolation=inherit` does **not** send that flag, so a
default-flags run cannot test the first row of the table — it would confirm the global skill loads
while never exercising the isolation claim, and record a false positive on the exact point this
section exists to hold. **Remove the temporary global skill afterwards.**

**Record a run as a presence matrix, not as prose.** For each binary, write down its executable path,
its `--version`, and one boolean per marker in the table above. Do **not** diff the raw answers —
they are model output, so wording and ordering vary between runs that observed the same thing. If
either positive control comes back false, record nothing from that run: fix the fixture and re-run.
And read a difference conservatively — the backend model is an uncontrolled variable, so a change is
*associated* with the binary, not proven caused by it. Reproduce it before concluding.

Observed under kimi-cli 0.147.0 with the flag set above, A/B'd against 0.146.0 with an identical
presence matrix (observations, not guarantees — re-run the probe rather than assuming they still
hold):

| Question | Observed |
|---|---|
| `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/` discovered despite `--ignore-user-config`? | **Yes**, body content reached the model |
| Project `.claude/skills/` discovered? | **No** |
| Parent-directory `AGENTS.md` above the git root loaded? | **No** — the upward walk is git-root-bounded (see the correction below) |
| `project_doc_max_bytes=0` fully disables loading? | **Not verified — do not assume** |

**Correction (2026-08-07), superseding the 2026-08-02 correction.** That earlier note recorded the
third row as **Yes** on both 0.145.0 and 0.146.0. It does not reproduce. Probing 0.146.0 and 0.147.0
side by side, the parent codeword was absent from **both**, in three variants: with a project
`AGENTS.md` present, with it removed (so no nearer file could mask the parent), and with `--cd` set
to a subdirectory of the repo. That last variant is the one that explains the mechanism rather than
just contradicting the record: from `repo/sub`, kimi **did** load `repo/AGENTS.md` — so it walks
upward from the resolved directory, but the walk stops at the git root and does not cross it. Both
positive controls were green in every run, so the instrument was working.

Read this as *the record was wrong*, not *0.147 changed*: new and old agree, and they disagree with
what was written down. What is retracted is the **mechanism** — "above the git root" — not the
concern. The corrected boundary is the git root, and the walk still starts at the **resolved
workspace directory**, which is not the same thing:

> **`resolve_workspace` returns an explicit `workspace_root` unchanged** (`_core/workspace.py`), so
> a caller may resolve the workspace to a *subdirectory* of a repository. The upward walk then
> crosses **above that directory** on its way to the git root. A caller who narrows
> `workspace_root` to `repo/sub` precisely in order to bound egress still ships `repo/AGENTS.md`,
> a file it never named and that lies outside the directory it selected.

So the published caveat — "the resolved workspace's `AGENTS.md`" — **does understate egress**, and
issue #472's conclusion stands even though the observation it cited does not. Correcting the
disclosure is a wording/meaning change to a `FINGERPRINT_COVERS` category and is tracked there, not
here; this section records only the corrected behavior. (An earlier draft of this note argued the
existing wording already covered the subdirectory case. It does not — "resolved workspace" is the
selected directory, not the enclosing repository — and the `--cd repo/sub` probe above is the
positive demonstration of exactly the egress path #472 describes.)

## Flag classes

- **ALWAYS_SEND_FLAGS** — guarantee-bearing (sandbox, cd, json, output-last-message, isolation,
  output-schema, …). Sent unconditionally and never gated on `--help`. If `kimi` removes or
  renames one, it rejects the invocation at argument parsing — before any model call, zero spend —
  and the failure is reported as `cli_contract_changed` with repair guidance.
- **HELP_GATED_FLAGS** — depth/cosmetic only (e.g. `--model`). Feature-detected via
  `kimi exec --help`; dropped gracefully if absent and noted in `meta.compat_warnings`.

## Reasoning-effort control (`model_reasoning_effort`, #309)

`kimi exec` 0.147.0 has no dedicated reasoning-effort flag (verified against
`kimi exec --help`, 2026-08-07 — the sole 0.146.0 → 0.147.0 addition is the unrelated
`--approve-for-me`, which this plugin never sends), so the per-call
`reasoning_effort` parameter and
`KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_REASONING_EFFORT` are sent as a **config override**:
`-c model_reasoning_effort="<value>"`, with the value **TOML-string-encoded** (JSON string syntax,
which is valid TOML). Kimi TOML-parses the `-c` right-hand side and falls back to a string only
when that parse fails, so a raw interpolation would retype boolean/numeric/collection-shaped values
(kimi 0.144.3 then rejects them locally as an invalid type) and silently unwrap quoted ones;
encoding makes the advertised open string round-trip exactly. A config key cannot be help-gated —
`--help` advertises flags,
not config keys — so a requested effort is sent unconditionally. Drift coverage is **narrower than
ALWAYS_SEND**: only removal of the `-c` flag itself fails loudly as `cli_contract_changed` with
zero spend. If a future `kimi` renames or removes the **key**, the drift is **silent** — kimi
tolerates unknown `-c` keys as junk it never reads (the same tolerance recorded for lookalike keys
below) — and the requested effort is quietly ignored; the re-verification probe in
`docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md` is the guard for that case. (Verified 2026-07-13: a CLI `-c` override
survives `--ignore-user-config`, so an explicit effort stays effective under every isolation mode.)

The **semantic value set** is open and not allowlisted by this plugin. The plugin still enforces
transport-shape bounds (length and argv/JSON safety); values passing those bounds are sent
unchanged. The CLI accepts such a string silently, and the **backend** rejects an unsupported
model/effort combination at request time with a 400 whose message carries
`[ReasoningEffortParam] [reasoning.effort] [invalid_enum_value] …` (probed against kimi-cli
0.144.3, 2026-07-13). That message also matches the generic `invalid value` drift pattern, so the
classifier checks `REASONING_EFFORT_REJECTION_MARKERS` (`reasoning.effort`,
`reasoningeffortparam` — deliberately **not** the config key name) first: when this run sent a
first-class effort override and **every marker appears in its bracketed `[…]` field form**, the
failure is the caller's argument (`invalid_reasoning_effort`), not contract drift. A marker as a
free substring does not match — an operator passthrough naming one (`--enable reasoning.effort`, a
profile so named) stays attributable to `extra_args_rejected`. A passthrough descriptor that
itself carries the full bracketed signature (a profile literally named
`[reasoning.effort][ReasoningEffortParam]`) is attributed to the passthrough *before* the backend
check, so it cannot impersonate the backend rejection either. A rejection naming only
`model_reasoning_effort` (the key) still fails loudly as `cli_contract_changed`. The accepted set
genuinely varies by model and account — the backend advertised
`none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh` for gpt-5.5 on ChatGPT, while the models cache advertises
`max`/`ultra` for other slugs — so discovery stays advisory (below) and no enum is pinned.

**Discovery** reads the same undocumented `models_cache.json` as the slug catalog: each entry's
`default_reasoning_level` (a string) and `supported_reasoning_levels` (a list of
`{effort, description, …}` objects, of which only the `effort` tokens are surfaced) map to
`ModelInfo.default_reasoning_effort` / `supported_reasoning_efforts`, defensively validated
(`REASONING_EFFORT_TOKEN_PATTERN`, `SUPPORTED_EFFORTS_MAX_ENTRIES`) and advisory only. The bundled
static fallback carries no effort data.

## Operator extra-args passthrough (`KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_EXTRA_ARGS`, #231)

An opt-in operator knob adds extra **global** `kimi` options to every paid `exec` invocation
(consult/review/delegate). It is a small allowlist — `-c`/`--config KEY=VALUE`, `-p`/`--profile NAME`,
`--enable`/`--disable FEATURE` — appended after the plugin's own help-gated tokens and before the
stdin sentinel, so it can select a `model_provider`/`--profile` (its motivating use is doing so under
`ignore-config` isolation, which sends `--ignore-user-config` and drops `config.toml`, leaving `-c`
the only lever) **without** displacing the envelope-bearing flags. Anything outside the allowlist is
refused at parse time with `extra_args_rejected`, before any spend.

This passthrough is **user-owned surface, not part of the CLI contract**: the option names/config
keys/profile names an operator supplies are their responsibility, so when `kimi` rejects one the
expected signature is `extra_args_rejected` (operator config to fix) — **not** `cli_contract_changed`.
Drift is attributed to the passthrough only when `kimi`'s rejection names one of the (sanitized)
descriptors this server injected; a rejection of a plugin-owned guarantee flag still fails loudly as
`cli_contract_changed`. Two boundaries the allowlist cannot fully police, and why:

- **`-c` values are free-form** and can override any dotted config path. Keys under `sandbox`,
  `approval_policy`, or `shell_environment_policy` are refused because they would weaken a guarantee
  this server advertises (the sandbox capability boundary, the delegate no-network-egress promise, the
  approval posture, or the host-env isolation of commands `kimi` runs). The key is normalized the way
  kimi's own `-c` parser trims it before this check, so a leading/segment space cannot slip a denied
  key past. A `-c` value may hold a secret, so it is never echoed in `kimi_status` or an error
  envelope.
- **`model` and `model_reasoning_effort` are reserved for the first-class controls** (#310, #309).
  `meta.model` (and `raw_response.model`) report the model the per-call `model` parameter or
  `KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_MODEL` requested, and `meta.reasoning_effort` reports the effort the per-call
  `reasoning_effort` parameter or `KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_REASONING_EFFORT` sent; a passthrough
  `-c model=…` / `-c model_reasoning_effort=…` would make the run use the operator's value while
  the envelope reports the per-call/server value (null in the common case), so both exact keys are
  refused at parse time. The parser also conservatively refuses case- and quote-varied lookalikes
  (`Model`, `"model_reasoning_effort"`) that kimi-rs 0.144.3 treats as distinct junk keys, not
  aliases. Set the env var or the per-call parameter instead — those flow into
  `resolved_defaults` and the meta fields correctly. This is not a `model_*` root reservation:
  `model_provider`/`model_providers.*` (this knob's motivating use case) and other `model_*`
  keys still pass through. An opaque `--profile` can still set either key — the operator-trust
  boundary below, restated, not closed.
- **`remote_plugin` is wholly plugin-owned in the passthrough.** Both `--enable remote_plugin` and
  `--disable remote_plugin`, and any `-c features.remote_plugin=…` (either spelling, since
  `--enable X` == `-c features.X=true`), are refused — the server manages this feature as a documented
  security guarantee (#287, above). `--disable` is refused even though it agrees with the plugin, so a
  drift on the plugin's own guarantee flag can't be misattributed to the operator's passthrough. The
  refusal also covers the bare **`-c features=…`** parent key (a TOML inline table that could reach
  `remote_plugin`) and quoted key segments that resolve to the same path (`features."remote_plugin"`,
  `"features".remote_plugin`). Other features set by their own dotted key (`-c features.some_other=true`,
  `--disable some_other`) are still allowed.
- **`--profile` layers an opaque on-disk TOML** this server cannot inspect. A profile can therefore
  re-introduce configuration the denylist would otherwise refuse, so a profile is a documented
  **operator-trust boundary** — only enable this knob with profiles you control.

## Version policy

Advisory only. A version outside the tested set warns (`kimi_status.version_warning`,
`StatusResult`) but never blocks — readiness depends only on the binary being found and
authenticated. Override the tested set with `KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` (comma-separated
`major.minor`).

## Result extraction

The final answer is read from the `--output-last-message` file (stable). The `--json` JSONL event
stream is parsed **tolerantly** for optional metadata only (token usage, session id, error events),
so an event-schema change degrades metadata rather than breaking a run.

## Session transfer (`kimi app-server`)

`kimi_transfer` imports a Claude Code session transcript into a resumable Kimi thread by driving
`kimi app-server` — a newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 stream over stdio (one JSON object per line, no
`Content-Length` framing). This whole surface is **experimental** upstream (`kimi app-server` is
labeled `[experimental]` and the import method rides behind the `experimentalApi` capability), so
every assumption lives in `cli_contract.py` (the `APP_SERVER_*` / `IMPORT_*` constants) and
`appserver.py`. Verified against `kimi-cli 0.147.0` via `kimi app-server generate-json-schema --out <DIR>`.
The 0.146.0 → 0.147.0 schema diff is additive only for the consumed surface (an optional
`extensions` map on `InitializeParams`, which this plugin does not send; an optional `title` on the
import progress/completed per-item results, which is read tolerantly and ignored; and two values
added to the `PlanType` enum — `self_serve_business_prolite` and `enterprise_cbp_automation` — read
as a free-form capped string rather than an enum), so nothing this plugin sends or reads changed.
The inventory pass added ten unconsumed v2 `ThreadSection*` messages and removed none.

The flow: `initialize` (with `capabilities.experimentalApi=true`) → `initialized` notification → one
`externalAgentConfig/import` request carrying a single `SESSIONS` migration item → wait for the
matching `externalAgentConfig/import/completed` notification → terminate the child. The client is
deliberately single-request (no broker, no session reuse).

**Thread-id discovery.** Two sources, in order:

1. **The completed notification** (`itemTypeResults[SESSIONS].successes[].target`) — the imported
   thread id, present on a **fresh** import. This is part of the app-server's *emitted* JSON schema
   (`generate-json-schema`), so it is the primary, versioned surface.
2. **The import ledger** `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/external_agent_session_imports.json` (undocumented — same drift
   class as `models_cache.json`) — read tolerantly and bounded, only as a fallback. Kimi deduplicates
   a byte-identical transcript to a silent no-op (empty `successes` **and** `failures`), so a
   re-import's thread id is recoverable only here, matched on `source_path` + `content_sha256`.

Because a live Claude session transcript grows on every turn, re-transferring it is **not** idempotent
— the changed bytes are a fresh import with a new thread; the ledger fallback only fires for a
genuinely unchanged (typically closed) transcript. An old CLI without the import method returns
JSON-RPC `-32601` (method-not-found) → `transfer_unsupported` (the hard backstop behind the advisory
version gate). A completed import with no `target` and no ledger record → `transfer_incomplete`, naming
the ledger it checked.

Any other error on the import *request* is classified by its JSON-RPC code, because the two cases have
opposite owners. A code in the reserved `-32768..-32000` range (invalid params/request, parse/internal
error, plus the server-defined `-32000..-32099` band) — or an error malformed enough to carry no integer
`code` — means **our request** drifted from the CLI's schema, so it fails loudly as
`cli_contract_changed`. An application-range code is Kimi rejecting **this transcript**, so it surfaces
as `transfer_failed` carrying the app-server's message. Broken stream or handshake (EOF, a non-JSON
line, an `initialize` error, a missing `kimiHome`) remains `cli_contract_changed`.

## Failure classification

A non-success `kimi exec` run is classified from its stderr/stdout and JSONL `error` events against
the signature sets in `cli_contract.py`, checked in order so a more specific cause is never masked by
a generic one:

1. **auth** (`AUTH_FAILURE_PATTERNS`) → `kimi_auth_required`.
2. **contract drift** (`CONTRACT_DRIFT_STDERR_PATTERNS`) → `cli_contract_changed`, **unless** the
   rejection names an operator `KIMI_IN_CLAUDE_EXTRA_ARGS` descriptor → `extra_args_rejected` instead
   (user-owned passthrough, not a plugin-contract drift; see the passthrough section above), **or**
   this run sent a first-class reasoning-effort override and the failure carries the backend's
   `REASONING_EFFORT_REJECTION_MARKERS` → `invalid_reasoning_effort` (a caller value to correct; see
   the reasoning-effort section above). Checked
   before rate-limit so a genuine contract change is never mistaken for a transient (retryable) failure.
3. **rate limit** (`RATE_LIMIT_PATTERNS`: `rate limit`, `too many requests`, `usage limit`, `quota`,
   `retry-after`, plus `429` matched with word boundaries so an incidental digit run can't fire it)
   → `kimi_rate_limited`, `temporary=True` with `retry_after_ms` set from a parsed
   `Retry-After`/"retry after Ns" value **when it is seconds-valued** (a non-second unit or HTTP-date
   is ignored), else `RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MS` (60s). Lets a caller back off deterministically
   instead of retry-storming a transient limit.
4. everything else → `nonzero_exit`.

Signatures are confirmed against real `kimi` output; this file is the source of truth for the
phrasings, so update `cli_contract.py` (one place) when upstream wording changes.

## Structured output

`--output-schema` uses OpenAI strict structured outputs: every property must appear in `required`
and every object must set `additionalProperties: false`. The findings schema in `schemas.py`
follows this (optional fields are nullable but still required).

## Canonical error envelope

Every `ok: false` response carries a uniform `error` object. The full schema is published at the
`kimi://error-envelope` resource (fetch it once and cache by `fingerprint`); clients should
read that resource rather than hard-code the shape.

**Key contract points:**

- `temporary` (bool) signals whether retrying can succeed; `retry_after_ms` is always present
  (`null` unless `temporary` is true). Callers must read `temporary` — not `retry_after_ms`
  presence — as the retry signal.
- `repair{next_step,tool,arguments,alternative}` provides a stable SYMBOLIC `next_step` label
  (e.g. `poll_job_status`, `correct_arguments`) that callers branch on in code; `tool`/`arguments`
  name a recovery tool call; `alternative` is prose fallback. The `repair` field is omitted only
  when no corrective path exists.
- `details{field,fields,reason,allowed_values}` describes the offending input(s): `field` names a
  single input; `fields` (mutually exclusive with `field`; non-empty, unique) names inputs whose
  *combination* is invalid (e.g. a combined-size limit where no single input is at fault). The
  rejected `value` is deliberately never echoed — a parameter can accept arbitrary input that may be
  a secret. Neither carrier is required; whichever is present (`field`, `fields`, or neither) plus
  `reason`/`allowed_values` is sufficient to repair the call.
- Absent optional fields are **omitted** from the payload (no placeholder nulls), except
  `retry_after_ms` which is always present.

**Opaque wire branch:** tools that publish `outputSchema` include a compact opaque error branch
(a discriminated `ok: false` object) rather than the full error schema inline. Callers must branch
on `ok` first; the full envelope shape lives solely at `kimi://error-envelope`. This keeps the
preloaded `tools/list` catalog compact.

**Stored job results across releases:** a persisted `result.json` is guaranteed readable only by
the release that wrote it. A backward-compatible *newer* release generally still reads it (added
fields are optional, and a compatible pre-upgrade payload is returned with `meta.fingerprint`
re-stamped to the current surface — pre-1.0, a breaking field removal/retype can end that).
**Cross-format replay is unsupported** (notably downgrade — the same code fires in the upgrade
direction after a breaking format change): each job record carries the writer's persisted-format
version (`RESULT_FORMAT`, stamped at spawn), and a stored result that fails validation under a
*different* recorded format is returned as `job_result_incompatible` — `temporary: false`, repair
`start_new_job` — because no retry can make this release able to read it (a reused
`idempotency_key` cannot succeed either; use a new one or none). A result that fails
validation under the *same*, a missing, or an unusable recorded format is corruption and stays
`internal_error` (message `"job result could not be returned: …"`).
(Records that have actually expired past their TTL still return `job_not_found`.)

## When `kimi` changes

Follow the full procedure in [`docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md`](docs/UPGRADING-KIMI.md): run the no-spend
drift check (`uv run python scripts/check_kimi_contract.py`), do the manual semantic review the
script can't, then update `cli_contract.py` (and the lockstep files), run the test gate plus the live
integration tests, and bump `FINGERPRINT`/`CHANGELOG.md` only if the agent-visible surface changed.
