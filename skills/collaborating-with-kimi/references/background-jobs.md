# Background jobs

Use the `_async` form when the corresponding consult, review, or delegate can exceed the synchronous
deadline (built-in default 300s) — a high-reasoning-effort or broad repo-grounded consult, a
multi-file or whole-branch review, or a substantial implementation task — since a sync deadline
expiry terminates the run and loses its partial paid work, whereas the job runs to a separately
configured deadline (built-in default 1800s). Starting it commits spend immediately; abandoning
polling does not stop the run.

## Lifecycle

1. Start exactly one matching `_async` tool and retain its `job_id`, `kind`, `poll_after_ms`, and
   workspace.
2. Wait at least `poll_after_ms`, then call `kimi_job_status` with the same absolute
   `workspace_root`.
3. While running, honor each new `poll_after_ms`. Activity fields are advisory; silence does not
   prove a stall.
4. When `result_available` is true, fetch with `kimi_job_result`.
5. Discriminate the fetched result in the order given in SKILL.md → Reading results; it matches the
   originating consult, review, or delegate type.

## Parallel work

Async also enables one bounded parallel pattern: start the matching `_async` tool, continue your own
independent work, poll at the next natural pause, and synthesize when the result arrives. The start
still counts as the one active call for that decision point — parallelism never adds calls. Do not
start a job whose result you do not intend to read; fire-and-forget is not a mode.

`kimi_job_consume_result` fetches the record and deletes it once the stored result reads back
intact; an unreadable stored result is kept. Use it only when destructive consumption is intended.
`kimi_job_cancel` requests cancellation; `kimi_job_list` can recover a lost job id.

Jobs are workspace-keyed and disk-backed. Their deadlines bound runtime. Retention begins after
completion, so read `ttl_seconds` and `expires_at` and fetch completed work promptly. A fetched
result is not a generic lifecycle success object: it has the same success schema as the originating
active tool, with originating run posture in `meta`.

Treat `kimi_capabilities` as authoritative for the current lifecycle tools, status fields, and
tool-specific errors.
