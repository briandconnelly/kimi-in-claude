"""Shared propose-tier orchestration.

`run_delegate` runs a coding task in an isolated git worktree (worktree create →
`kimi exec` with `workspace-write` → capture diff → cleanup) and returns the
normalized result envelope WITHOUT touching the live tree. Both the synchronous
`kimi_delegate` tool and the background `_worker` call this, so the worktree
logic lives in exactly one place. This module is import-light (no FastMCP app) so
the background worker can use it without constructing the server.
