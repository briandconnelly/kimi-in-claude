"""Import-light orchestration for the read-only tiers (consult, review).

Both the synchronous tools in ``server.py`` and the detached ``_worker.py`` call
these, so this module must NOT import the FastMCP app (``server``) — like
``delegate.run_delegate`` for the propose tier. It builds the prompt, runs
``kimi -p``, and finalizes the structured result envelope. For review it also
gathers and validates the diff *before* any model call, so an async review job that
hits a bad scope/base/commit spends nothing.
