"""Shared parameter-contract registry (issue #333).

Some parameters — `idempotency_key`, `reasoning_effort` — carry lengthy lifecycle
or validation semantics. MCP inlines a parameter's description into *every* tool's
`inputSchema`, so a 1 KB description repeated across six tools costs ~6 KB on the
`tools/list` wire. This registry holds each such parameter's description in two
parts:

- ``summary`` — the compressed form that ships inline on the wire. It must stay
  independently sufficient for a correct first call: the first-call selection,
  safety, and spend-critical facts (including any egress/security guarantee the
  parameter carries), plus a pointer to the full home.
- ``full`` — the complete, authoritative semantics, served (uncompressed, once)
  from the ``kimi://params`` resource.

Both live on the same :class:`ParamContract`, authored and reviewed together, so
the inline summary and the resource body cannot drift into two independent
sources of truth. The server builds each `Field(description=...)` from ``summary``
and the resource body from ``full``.

This is kimi-specific surface (the semantics describe *these* tools), so it lives
in the package rather than in ``_core``.

    "the MCP boundary as invalid_arguments; the same hostile shape in the resolved "
